READY72 — KOE MODULE (v0.1)
--------------------------------
ONE STEP ONLY (per your workflow):

STEP 1 — Upload and extract this ZIP at your repo root.
  - This adds the following files:
    • src/koe/types.ts
    • src/koe/engine.ts
    • src/koe/regions.coastal.ts
    • src/koe/useKOE.ts
    • src/components/KOEPanel.tsx

DO NOT delete anything yet. Do not wire routes yet.
Reply "STEP 1 complete" and I will give you STEP 2 (exact, minimal wiring).
