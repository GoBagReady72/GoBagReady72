❗ Required cleanup (do these before redeploy):
1) DELETE any of these files if present in your repo root:
   - middleware.ts
   - middleware.js
   - next.config.js
2) Ensure package.json does NOT depend on "next". This is a Vite app.
3) In Vercel → Project → Settings → General → Framework = Vite.
4) In Vercel → Project → Settings → Build & Output:
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
